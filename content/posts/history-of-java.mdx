Hello guys, I'm going to tell you a story. That is "how Java got that name?"
Let's find out. This programming language was developed by Sun Microsystems. It
was initially released on January 23, 1996. James Gosling was known as the
founder of Java. Before they called it Java, its name was "Oak". But there was
another company with the same name. So, James Gosling and his team decided to
change its name.

Have you seen the logo of Java programming language? Is it a cup of tea?
Actually, it is not a cup of tea. It is a cup of coffee. Why is that so?

Java is an island in Indonesia. It is the place where the first coffee was made.
There is a famous coffee variant called Java. The "Java" name was chosen by
James Gosling while having a cup of coffee since many team members agreed to
that name.

Sun Microsystems became a part of Oracle later. So, now we know Java as oracle
owned. The first JDK was released on January 23, 1996 as JDK 1.0. Today, I'm
using JDK 20 while writing this article. We are using Java for many purposes
like mobile app development, web development, and desktop software development.

Java is famous for OOP concepts. Beginners can easily learn OOP concepts with
java. But, it is not a 100% OOP language. We have to lot of things to talk about
java. So, stay alert with me. I will write more articles about software
development and ICT.
